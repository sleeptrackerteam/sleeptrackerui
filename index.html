          <h4>Sleep as a Necessity</h4>
          <p>As anyone would understand after dealing with the effects of sleep deprivation for any given period of time, sleep is something to be respected simply out of what it provides us. Not sleeping can cause all sorts of problems, affecting so many areas of our lives. Just the act of going out or even staying sane throughout the day is made immeasurably harder without a solid base of sleep.</p>
